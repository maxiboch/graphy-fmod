## What's Different in This Fork?

This custom version combines the best of several community contributions:

### Integrated Pull Requests from Upstream:
- **[PR #121](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/pull/121)**: Conditional audio module - allows toggling the audio module on/off
- **[PR #124](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/pull/124)**: Fix to prevent IndexOutOfRangeException
- **[PR #123](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/pull/123)**: Reset FPS monitor functionality
- **[PR #122](https://github.com/Tayx94/graphy/pull/122)**: **Double-ended queue implementation** for faster percentile updates (O(n) operation where n is 1% of sample buffer)

### CPU & GPU Tracking from paulatwarp:
Integrated CPU and GPU tracking features from [paulatwarp's fork](https://github.com/paulatwarp/graphy) (commits 82c8cca and 227173d):
- **Separate CPU and GPU time tracking** with millisecond precision
- **ms/f display** instead of FPS for more precise frame timing analysis
- Works on platforms that support `CaptureFrameTimings()` (must be enabled in player settings)
- Numerically stable variance calculation for percentiles

### Important Technical Choice:
- **Uses double-ended queue (deque) from PR #122** instead of ring buffer implementations
- Ring buffer commits (885fe85 and 518ee59) were explicitly **excluded** in favor of the more efficient deque implementation

### NEW: FMOD Audio System Monitoring (v0.3.0)
This fork includes a comprehensive FMOD monitoring module that tracks:
- **FMOD CPU Usage**: DSP, streaming, geometry, update, and Studio CPU percentages
- **FMOD Memory**: Current and peak memory allocation in MB
- **Active Channels**: Number of channels currently playing
- **File I/O**: Stream and sample bytes read per second
- **Audio Level Metering**: Real-time RMS and peak levels for L/R channels in dB

#### FMOD Module Features:
- **Conditional Compilation**: Uses `GRAPHY_FMOD` directive, only compiles when FMOD is present
- **Audio Metering**: Real-time RMS/peak level monitoring via master channel group
- **Full Integration**: Complete GraphyManager integration with state management
- **GC-free Design**: Pre-allocated buffers and double-ended queues
- **Automatic Detection**: Works with FMOD Core System (not just Studio)
- **No Profiling Required**: Uses Core API functions, no FMOD profiling flag needed
- **Visual Graphs**: CPU, memory, channels, and audio level visualization
- **Color-coded Thresholds**: Performance warnings for all metrics
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Current, average, and peak values for all metrics

#### FMOD Module Requirements:
- FMOD for Unity package installed in project
- Works with FMOD Core API 2.0+
- Automatically detects FMOD Core System at runtime
- No special FMOD configuration required

Graphy is the ultimate, easy to use, feature packed FPS Counter, stats monitor and debugger for your Unity project.

**Main Features:**
- Graph & Text:
  - FPS
  - Memory
  - Audio

With this tool you will be able to visualize and catch when your game has some unexpected hiccup or stutter, and act accordingly! 

The debugger allows you to set one or more conditions, that if met will have the consequences you desire, such as taking a screenshot, pausing the editor, printing a message to the console and more! Even call a method from your own code if you want! 

**Additional features:**
- Customizable look and feel 
- Multiple layouts 
- Custom Inspector 
- Hotkeys 
- Easy to use API (accessible from code) 
- Works on multiple platforms

### Contributing

Let's make Graphy the go-to for stats monitoring in Unity!

I would really appreciate any contributions! Below you can find a roadmap for future planned features and optimisations that you might be able to help out with. If you want to make a big pull request, please do it on the "dev" branch.

Create a GitHub issue if you want to start a discussion or request a feature, and please label appropriately.

You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2KgNEHK?) for active discussions with other members of the community.

### Roadmap

**Planned features (No ETA):**

  - Add GfxDriver stats to the RAM module.
  - Scale Canvas (GetComponent<Canvas>().scaleFactor *= multiplier;) -> If it changes, set again.
  - Make a template for a graph + text module so people can create their own easily.
  - Allow storing FPS for a predetermined time to allow benchmarks.
  - Dump all Graphy Data as a string to:
  	- File.
	- Send to server.
	- Send mail.
  - Add a preprocessor key #GRAPHY to avoid adding the asset in builds.
